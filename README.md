App.net Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides App.net syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles and status updates.

It provides basic status update and long post syndication; currently more advanced features (file uploads, starring etc) are not supported,
but as always, pull requests are welcome.

* Go to Settings -> APP.NET
* Enter your oauth details, then users will be able to link their accounts

TODO
----

* [ ] Image (and other media) upload via attachments, perhaps using my oEmbed plugin
